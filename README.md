# Example Empirical Paper

This is a barebones example of how to write an empirical paper for [ECON 480 - Econometrics](https://metricsf19.classes.ryansafner.com) using the data from Stock and Watson 2007 on how class size affects test scores.

This project contains just three important files in the main directory:

- `paper.Rmd`: the main file for writing the paper in markdown, including all associated code, figures, and tables
- `paper.pdf`: knitted result of `paper.Rmd`
- `caschool.dta`: the raw data to be used

This is one method of organizing files, and performing *all* tasks (writing text; importing, wrangling, and analyzing data; creating tables and plots) in a single file - `paper.Rmd`.

To see another method of organization and separation of tasks across multiple files and folders, see my [Workflow](https://github.com/ryansafner/workflow) repository for an example.
